# Lets set up!

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Before starting up your new project with fairy, some prepare work is needed.

# A. Using the template 

Fairy Framework provides a baseline template with various basic utilities, including:
- A module manager which will load any additional modules into the game
- A basic command
- A basic main class


To create using the template, please visit [the template by clicking here](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy-bukkit-module-template)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url='../../video/setting-up.mp4' />

By following the tutorial you should be able to speed-run the setting up process.

# B. Setting up manually

For the ones that are not faint of heart, my congratulations, and my sorry's. To set up fairy, you first
need to add the Imanity Repository as part of your `settings.gradle`:

```java
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // These should be by default
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()

        // -- Add this -- 
        maven {
            url "https://repo.imanity.dev/imanity-libraries"
        }
        // -------------- 
    }
}
```

As the next step, you must declare the plugin:

```java
plugins {
    // Fairy needs ShadowJar to function
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '7.1.2'
    id 'io.fairyproject' version '0.6.6b3-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Then, in the same `build.gradle`, you must set up the Fairy Project plugin:

```java
fairy {
    // This is your main package that WILL be scanned
    mainPackage.set("my.test.plugin")

    // Optional: adds bukkit api notice for 1.13
    bukkitProperties().bukkitApi = "1.13"
}

build {
    dependsOn(shadowJar)
}
```

#### Adding libraries

To add libraries from fairy, it is as simple as adding regular libraries:

```java
dependencies {
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-bundles")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.animation")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-command")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-menu")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.hologram")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.config")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.nametag")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.sidebar")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-visibility")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-visual")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-timer")
    api("io.fairyproject:bukkit-nbt")
    api("io.fairyproject:module.tablist")
}
```

There is no need to version these as they are versioned in regards to the plugin version.

#### Recommended: Relocating

It is **HIGHLY** recommended to relocate your Fairy Framework to prevent conflicts. Do so by 
adding the following task:

```java
shadowJar {
    relocate("io.fairyproject", "my.test.plugin.fairy")
}
```
